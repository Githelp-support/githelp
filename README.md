## What is Githelp?

[Githelp](https://githelp.app/) is a support service platform letting open source projects easily get a custom standalone 
support site for their OSS project. The support site is set up for free, provides all necessary infrastructure, gives a kickback 
from all support provided, and can be integrated with Discord or distributed as a URL in any desired channel.

professional support and receiving financial kickback from the support provided. We believe this will contribute in making it 
easier for companies and organisations to put their faith in open source code, as the support system and help functions will 
feel more solid and reliable, when planning for long-term operations.
