## Our vision

Make open source prosjects competitve options to commercial cloud-based SaaS, by giving them a custom platform for providing
professional support and receiving financial kickback from the support provided. We believe this will contribute in making it 
easier for companies and organisations to put their faith in open source code, as the support system and help functions will 
feel more solid and reliable planning for long-term operations. 

## What We Offer

### For open source projects
- **Support put in system:** Easily schedule, receive payments, and gather reviews for your open source project.
- **Community Focus:** We believe in the growth of open source. Earn a kickback for the support performed with your
  repo. Encourage your repo members to join the platform and get compensated for their support efforts.
- **Monthly Support Statistics:** Gain insights into user interactions with your service. Concentrate your
   development efforts where it matters most by understanding how users are utilizing your support and where they may be
   encountering challenges.

### For developers in need of support 
- **Effortless Support:** Easily schedule, pay, and get help on the open source projects you are using.

### For developers helping with support

  developers would prefer to be compensated, and would be willing to spend more time on support if there was a compensation in place.
- **Community Focus:** Help out the open source projects you like and give back to community, in a more sustainable way, where
  your efforts are being compensated. 
- **Clear and Transparent tickets:** Details about help wanted easily summarised in a concrete and structured way.
