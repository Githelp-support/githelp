## What is Githelp?

[Githelp](https://githelp.app/) is a free-to-use (for open-source) support infrastructure platform that solves 3 major problems. 

1. Easily provide paid support to users.
2. Seemlessly engage the community in support efforts.
3. Providing businesses greater trust in your products through Support-Level agreements and the accessibility of support.

As only a fraction of businesses contribute to open-source through donations or PRs, we want to enable businesses to give back to projects they care about in the form of paid support. In the coming times it will become more and more important to have experts in specific fields that can help users where AI does not yet suffice.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to make it easier for developers to access and compensate quality support while encouraging businesses to contribute more to Open Source through paid support and improve community engagement and benefits.

## What are helpers?

A helper is someone who contributes in the support efforts. This can be an external person or someone within your team, Githelp supports both and we also encourage both approaches so you can get your community involved and discover talent. We provide infrastructure for payments so you don't have to worry about it. Whenever support is provided the payment will be split according to your configuration between the helper, your project and Githelp (service-fee).
