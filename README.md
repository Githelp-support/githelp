## What is Githelp?

[Githelp](https://githelp.app/) is a support infrastructure platform that lets owners of open source software easily provide their users with expert help, 
community help and AI-support - all in one assistant - installed to Discord, their users´ Slack or through our website.

## Our Mission

Enable easy, seamless and high-quality access to support without going outside the familiar communication channels already used 
by businesses and repositories today. This means making support available from Discord, Slack and Github, in an intelligent and diversified manner. Read more about our mission [here](https://githelp.app/manifesto).

## How to Get Started for Repositories

To set up Githelp support for your open source project, follow these steps:

1. [Register](https://support.githelp.app/register) your project on Githelp.
2. Choose to install our assistant to Discord and/or set up a custom support landing page for your particular project.
3. Encourage your repo members to join Githelp to make their support efforts compensated.

**See how Githelp appears** on the Github site of for example [Cratis Chronicle](https://github.com/Cratis/Chronicle).
