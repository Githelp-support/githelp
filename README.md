## What is Githelp?

[Githelp](https://githelp.app/) is a free-to-use (for open-source) support infrastructure platform that solves 3 major problems. Providing the possibility to easily provide paid support to users, the possibility to seemlessly engage the community in support efforts and providing businesses greater trust in your products through Support-Level agreements and the accessibility of support.

As only a fraction of businesses contribute to open-source through donations or PRs, we want to enable businesses to give back to projects they care about in the form of paid support. In the coming times it will become more and more important to have experts in specific fields that can help users where AI does not yet suffice.

- Engage your community and discover talent within your community while providing your users with expert help.
- Provide the possibility for businesses to support your project through paid support.
- Provide Support-Level agreements to your users so they can feel confident about using your product.
- Free for open-source projects (For businesses the first 1 year is free and there is no per-seat costs). There is however a reasonable service charge per transaction made through the platform.
- Integrations for Discord, Slack and more.

## What are helpers?

A helper is someone who contributes in the support efforts. This can be an external person or someone within your team, Githelp supports both and we also encourage both approaches so you can get your community involved and discover talent. We provide infrastructure for payments so you don't have to worry about it. Whenever support is provided the payment will be split according to your configuration between the helper, your project and Githelp (service-fee).
