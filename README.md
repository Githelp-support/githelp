## What is Githelp?

community help and AI-support - all in one assistant - installed to Discord, their users´ Slack or through our website.

## Our Mission

Enable easy, seamless and high-quality access to support without going outside the familiar communication channels already used 
by businesses and repositories today. This means making support available from Discord, Slack and Github, in an intelligent and diversified manner. Read more about our mission [here](https://githelp.app/manifesto).
