## Our Mission

 easy, seamless and high-quality access to support without going outside the familiar communication channels already used 
by repositories and businesses today. This means making support available from Discord, Slack and Github, in an intelligent and diversified manner. Read more about our mission and the idea behind the project [here](https://githelp.app/manifesto).

## How to Get Started for Repositories

To set up Githelp support for your open source project, follow these steps:

1. [Register](https://support.githelp.app/register) your project on Githelp.
2. Choose to install our assistant to Discord and/or set up a custom support landing page for your particular project.
3. Encourage your repo members to join Githelp to make their support efforts compensated.

**See how Githelp appears** on the Github site of for example [Cratis Chronicle](https://github.com/Cratis/Chronicle). 
Follow their Githelp-badge to see their dedicated Githelp support-site. 

## How it Works for Users of Support

1. The user is directed to your dedicated support page from existing channels.
2. Explain your issue
3. Get help from validated helpers, validated by either us or the repository´s core team.
