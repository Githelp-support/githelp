## Our Mission

Enable easy, seamless and high-quality access to support without going outside the familiar communication channels already used 
by businesses and repositories today. This means making support available from Discord, Slack and Github, in an intelligent and diversified manner. 

## Why Githelp Might Be a Match

### For Repositories
- **Support Set in System:** Install an assistant to your Discord server and/or get a dedicated support page for your repository,
  with scheduling, payments and ticket details all in one place.
- **Earn a Commission:** We believe in the growth of open source. Earn a commission for the support performed with your
  repo. Encourage your repo members to join the platform and get compensated for their support efforts.
- **Get Statistics and Insights:** We share statistics and insight about the support provided, helping you to prioritise your efforts. 

### For Businesses
- **Core Team Support:** Get help from those who have developed the source code.
- **Transparent and fair pricing:** No subscription cost and a low start price for every issue.
- **Easy and simple to use:** Create a ticket in minutes, and get instant support if there are experts available for the OS project in
  question. 

### For Users of Support 
- **Core Team Support:** Get help from those who have developed the source code.
- **Sponsor While Getting Help:** It can be difficult to ask your employer to sponsor a repository you are using through donations.
  With Githelp you support the open source projcts you like, while also getting help with the issues you encounter.
- **Simple to Use:** Speed up your production and get past issues faster, while making it simple for your employer to make payments.
  

### For Providers of Support 
- **Get Paid:** Help out the open source projects you like, and give back to community in a more sustainable way, where your efforts
  are also being compensated. 
- **Easily Make Yourself Accessible:** We use Discord´s online status to see whether you are up for tasks.
- **Choose Which Tickets You Want to Pick:** Pick the tickets that suits your skill set and your calendar. 

## Get Started in Minutes

**Create Your Repo Support Page:** Register your repo and create a customized support page in minutes. The page provides users with 
information on how to get help, pricing details, and the ability to create support tickets.

**See how Githelp appears** on the Github site of repositories such as [DJV](https://github.com/korzio/djv), [JsonHilo](https://github.com/xtao-org/jsonhilo), and [quasar-admin](https://github.com/pratik227/quasar-admin).
