## What is Githelp?

[Githelp](https://githelp.app/) is a free-to-use (for open-source) support infrastructure platform with the following main features: 

1. Easily provide paid support to your users.
2. Seemlessly engage your community in support efforts - through automated payouts from support.
3. Control your pricing model and reach - Set your own rates (from 0 and upwards) and decide where to distribute your support landing page. 
4. Provide businesses with greater trust in your products through Support-Level Agreements and the general accessibility of support.

As only a fraction of businesses contribute to open-source through donations or PRs, we want to enable businesses to give back to projects they care about in the form of paid support.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to make it easier for developers to access and compensate quality support. And make it easier for project owners and contributors to offer and get compensated for any support given. 

We believe this can accelerate and help with funding for great OS (and closed source) projects, while improving community engagement and benefits for those who help out.

## Take our tours to see how it works

We have created tours from the perspective of various user-groups. Please feel free to have a look at our tours to better understand the value of the platform and where Githelp fits into your project.

## What are helpers?

A helper is someone who contributes in the support efforts. This can be an external person or someone within your team. Githelp supports both helper types and we also encourage both approaches so you can build flexible teams, get your community involved and discover new talent. We provide infrastructure for payments so you don't have to worry about it. Whenever support is provided the payment will be split according to your configuration between the helper, your project and Githelp (service-fee).

## How to Get Started for Repositories

To set up Githelp support for your open source project, follow these steps:

1. [Become a beta user](https://githelp.app/become-a-beta-user) (special benefits provided for beta participants)
2. Fill out the form to get started.

**See how Githelp appears** on the Github site of for example [Cratis Chronicle](https://github.com/Cratis/Chronicle). 
Follow their Githelp-badge to see their dedicated Githelp support-site. 

## How it Works for Users of Support

1. The user is directed to your dedicated support page from existing channels - such as your Discord, your website, or your Slack.
2. The user explains their issue.
4. The user gets help from helpers validated by your team.

## Why not only AI support?

AI will for many be the first support-line to answer user questions. However, not all problems can or should be solved by AI and might need your teams´ expertise. We believe expert knowledge is important to cover areas where AI does not yet suffice. AI development powered by niche experts.

## Other notes

- Integrations for Discord, Slack and more.
- Completely free for open source projects and businesses for the first 12 months after launch. Githelp will in this period only charge the Stripe fee when carrying out paid support transactions. After 12 months open source projects will be charged a commission fee per transaction, whereas businesses will be charged subscription fee.
