Welcome to Githelp! We prioritize the privacy and security of your information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we
collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our services.

## Information Collection and Use

### Information You Provide

When using Githelp's support services, you may share personal information such as your email address and details about
the issues you need help with. This information is used to facilitate communication and provide support.

### Contact Information

Your email address is used for support-related communication and is not shared with third parties without explicit
consent, except as required by law.

### Support Sessions

Interactions during support sessions (video, voice, or text chat) are recorded for quality assurance and training
purposes, ensuring the effectiveness of our services. Recordings are kept confidential and are not shared externally
unless required by law or for service improvement.

## Expert Validation and Access to Information

### Expert Access

Experts providing support are validated and have access to necessary repository information solely for accurate
assistance.

### Confidentiality

Experts are bound by confidentiality agreements and are prohibited from sharing user information with unauthorized
parties.

## Payment and Feedback

### Payment Information

Users pay an initial fee and a rate per minute for support services. Payment details are communicated via email, and
Githelp does not store or process payment information directly, relying on secure payment processors.

### User Feedback

After a support session, users receive an email requesting feedback and a rating. This input is used to improve services
and enhance user experience.

## Security Measures

### Data Security

Githelp employs industry-standard security measures to protect user information from unauthorized access, alteration,
disclosure, or destruction.

### Data Retention

User data collected during support sessions is retained for a limited period necessary for quality assurance and
training. Afterward, it is securely deleted.

## Changes in Privacy Policy

Githelp reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy. Users will be notified of any changes, and continued use of
our services after modifications constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
