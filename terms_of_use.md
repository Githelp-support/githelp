Welcome to Githelp! Our commitment is to protect your privacy and ensure the confidentiality of your information. This
Terms of Use outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard the personal information you provide while using our services.

## Information Collection and Use

### Information You Provide

When using Githelp's support services, users may provide personal information such as their email address and details
regarding the issue they need help with. This information is used to facilitate communication and provide support.

### Contact Information

Users share their email address to enable communication between themselves and experts offering support through Githelp.
This information is used solely for support-related purposes and is not shared with third parties without explicit
consent, except as required by law.

### Support Sessions

During support sessions, users may engage through video-chat, voice chat, or text chat. These interactions are recorded
for quality assurance and training purposes to ensure the effectiveness of our services. Recordings are kept
confidential and are not shared externally unless required by law or for service improvement purposes.

## Expert Validation and Access to Information

### Expert Access

Githelp ensures that experts offering support are validated and have access to necessary repository information solely
for the purpose of providing accurate and effective assistance.

### Confidentiality

Experts are bound by confidentiality agreements and are required to handle user information with the utmost care. They
are prohibited from sharing any user-provided information with unauthorized parties.

## Payment and Feedback

### Payment Information

Users are required to pay an initial fee and a rate per minute for support services. Payment details are communicated
via email after the support session concludes. Githelp does not store or process payment information directly. We
partner with secure payment processors to handle transactions.

### User Feedback

After the support session ends, users receive an email requesting feedback and a rating of the assistance received. This
feedback is used to improve our services and enhance user experience.

## Security Measures

### Data Security

Githelp employs industry-standard security measures to protect user information from unauthorized access, alteration,
disclosure, or destruction.

### Data Retention

User data collected during support sessions, including recordings, is retained for a limited period necessary for
quality assurance and training purposes. Afterward, it is securely deleted.

Githelp reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy as necessary. Users will be notified of any changes, and
continued use of our services after such modifications constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
